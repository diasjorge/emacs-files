# when viewing this file in emacs, press Shift+Tab 3 times to expand all headings.

Note: When talking about keys, QWERTY is assumed to indicate the key, unless otherwise specified. For example, “Changed M+y to something”, that “y” means the key that is under the key 7. (which is Dvorak's “f”).

* version 5.3.3, 2010-05-24

** Ctrl+p now asks for confirmation before printing
Ctrl+p will now ask user confirmation before printing the current buffer.
This is to prevent unintentional printing.
Old Emacs users tends to press Ctrl+p a lot because that used to be moving cursor up.

* version 4.3.12, 2009-08-13

* version 4.3.7, 2009-05-27

** ibuffer's M-s changed in emacs 23, such that M-s is now a prefix. For Dvorak users, M-s should be isearch. This is reclaimed to be isearch. For qwerty users, M-s should be other-window. Fixed.

* version 4.3.6, 2009-05-26

** Removed C-x o for other-window. (use Alt+s and Alt+Shift+s instead.)

* version 4.3.1, 2009-03-04
