Overview

    Folds are a way of hierarchically organizing the text in a file, so
    that the text can be viewed and edited at different levels. It is
    similar to Outline mode in that parts of the text can be hidden from
    view. A fold is a region of text, surrounded by special \"fold marks\",
    which act like brackets, grouping the text. Fold mark pairs can be
    nested, and they can have titles. When a fold is folded, the text is
    hidden from view, except for the first line, which acts like a title
    for the fold.

    Folding mode is a minor mode, designed to cooperate with many other
    major modes, so that many types of text can be folded while they are
    being edited (eg., plain text, program source code, Texinfo, etc.).

Folding-mode function

    If Folding mode is not called interactively (`(interactive-p)' is nil),
    and it is called with two or less arguments, all of which are nil, then
    the point will not be altered if `folding-folding-on-startup' is set
    and `folding-whole-buffer' is called. This is generally not a good
    thing, as it can leave the point inside a hidden region of a fold, but
    it is required if the local variables set \"mode: folding\" when the
    file is first read (see `hack-local-variables').

    Not that you should ever want to, but to call Folding mode from a
    program with the default behavior (toggling the mode), call it with
    something like `(folding-mode nil t)'.

    For most types of folded file, lines representing folds have \"{{{\"
    near the beginning. To enter a fold, move the point to the folded line
    and type `\\[folding-shift-in]'. You should no longer be able to see
    the rest of the file, just the contents of the fold, which you couldn't
    see before. You can use `\\[folding-shift-out]' to leave a fold, and
    you can enter and exit folds to move around the structure of the file.

    All of the text is present in a folded file all of the time. It is just
    hidden. Folded text shows up as a line (the top fold mark) with \"...\"
    at the end. If you are in a fold, the mode line displays \"inside n
    folds Narrow\", and because the buffer is narrowed you can't see outside
    of the current fold's text.

    By arranging sections of a large file in folds, and maybe subsections
    in sub-folds, you can move around a file quickly and easily, and only
    have to scroll through a couple of pages at a time. If you pick the
    titles for the folds carefully, they can be a useful form of
    documentation, and make moving though the file a lot easier. In
    general, searching through a folded file for a particular item is much
    easier than without folds.

Managing folds

    To make a new fold, set the mark at one end of the text you want in the
    new fold, and move the point to the other end. Then type
    `\\[folding-fold-region]'. The text you selected will be made into a
    fold, and the fold will be entered. If you just want a new, empty fold,
    set the mark where you want the fold, and then create a new fold there
    without moving the point. Don't worry if the point is in the middle of
    a line of text, `folding-fold-region' will not break text in the middle
    of a line. After making a fold, the fold is entered and the point is
    positioned ready to enter a title for the fold. Do not delete the fold
    marks, which are usually something like \"{{{\" and \"}}}\". There may
    also be a bit of fold mark which goes after the fold title.

    If the fold markers get messed up, or you just want to see the whole
    unfolded file, use `\\[folding-open-buffer]' to unfolded the whole
    file, so you can see all the text and all the marks. This is useful for
    checking/correcting unbalanced fold markers, and for searching for
    things. Use `\\[folding-whole-file]' to fold the buffer again.

    `folding-shift-out' will attempt to tidy the current fold just before
    exiting it. It will remove any extra blank lines at the top and bottom,
    (outside the fold marks). It will then ensure that fold marks exists,
    and if they are not, will add them (after asking). Finally, the number
    of blank lines between the fold marks and the contents of the fold is
    set to 1 (by default).

Folding package customizations

    If the fold marks are not set on entry to Folding mode, they are set to
    a default for current major mode, as defined by
    `folding-mode-marks-alist' or to \"{{{ \" and \"}}}\" if none are
    specified.

    To bind different commands to keys in Folding mode, set the bindings in
    the keymap `folding-mode-map'.

    The hooks `folding-mode-hook' and `<major-mode-name>-folding-hook' are
    called before folding the buffer and applying the key bindings in
    `folding-mode-map'. This is a good hook to set extra or different key
    bindings in `folding-mode-map'. Note that key bindings in
    `folding-mode-map' are only examined just after calling these hooks;
    new bindings in those maps only take effect when Folding mode is being
    started. The hook `folding-load-hook' is called when Folding mode is
    loaded into Emacs.

Mouse behavior

    If you want folding to detect point of actual mouse click, please see
    variable `folding-mouse-yank-at-p'.

    To customise the mouse actions, look at `folding-behave-table'." t nil)

Insert an editable text table.
Insert a table of specified number of COLUMNS and ROWS.  Optional
parameter CELL-WIDTH and CELL-HEIGHT can specify the size of each
cell.  The cell size is uniform across the table if the specified size
is a number.  They can be a list of numbers to specify different size
for each cell.  When called interactively, the list of number is
entered by simply listing all the numbers with space characters
delimiting them.

Examples:

\\[table-insert] inserts a table at the current point location.

Suppose we have the following situation where `-!-' indicates the
location of point.

    -!-

Type \\[table-insert] and hit ENTER key.  As it asks table
specification, provide 3 for number of columns, 1 for number of rows,
5 for cell width and 1 for cell height.  Now you shall see the next
table and the point is automatically moved to the beginning of the
first cell.

    +-----+-----+-----+
    |-!-  |     |     |
    +-----+-----+-----+

Inside a table cell, there are special key bindings. \\<table-cell-map>

M-9 \\[table-widen-cell] (or \\[universal-argument] 9 \\[table-widen-cell]) widens the first cell by 9 character
width, which results as

    +--------------+-----+-----+
    |-!-           |     |     |
    +--------------+-----+-----+

Type TAB \\[table-widen-cell] then type TAB M-2 M-7 \\[table-widen-cell] (or \\[universal-argument] 2 7 \\[table-widen-cell]).  Typing
TAB moves the point forward by a cell. The result now looks like this:

    +--------------+------+--------------------------------+
    |              |      |-!-                             |
    +--------------+------+--------------------------------+

If you knew each width of the columns prior to the table creation,
what you could have done better was to have had given the complete
width information to `table-insert'.

Cell width(s): 14 6 32

instead of 

Cell width(s): 5

This would have eliminated the previously mentioned width adjustment
work all together.

If the point is in the last cell type S-TAB S-TAB to move it to the
first cell.  Now type \\[table-heighten-cell] which heighten the row by a line.

    +--------------+------+--------------------------------+

    -!-

Type M-x table-insert-row instead of \\[table-insert-row-column].  \\[table-insert-row-column] does not work
when the point is outside of the table.  This insertion at
outside of the table effectively appends a row at the end.

(autoload (quote table-insert-sequence) "table" "\
Travel cells forward while inserting a specified sequence string in each cell.
STR is the base string from which the sequence starts.  When STR is an
empty string then each cell content is erased.  When STR ends with
numerical characters (they may optionally be surrounded by a pair of
parentheses) they are incremented as a decimal number.  Otherwise the
last character in STR is incremented in ASCII code order.  N is the
number of sequence elements to insert.  When N is negative the cell
traveling direction is backward.  When N is zero it travels forward
entire table.  INCREMENT is the increment between adjacent sequence
elements and can be a negative number for effectively decrementing.
INTERVAL is the number of cells to travel between sequence element
insertion which is normally 1.  When zero or less is given for
INTERVAL it is interpreted as number of cells per row so that sequence
is placed straight down vertically as long as the table's cell
structure is uniform.  JUSTIFY is one of the symbol 'left, 'center or
'right, that specifies justification of the inserted string.

Example:

  (progn
    (table-insert 16 3 5 1)
    (table-forward-cell 15)
    (table-insert-sequence \"D0\" -16 1 1 'center)

Convert plain text into a table by capturing the text in the region.
Create a table with the text in region as cell contents.  BEG and END
specify the region.  The text in the region is replaced with a table.
The removed text is inserted in the table.  When optional
COL-DELIM-REGEXP and ROW-DELIM-REGEXP are provided the region contents
is parsed and separated into individual cell contents by using the
delimiter regular expressions.  This parsing determines the number of
columns and rows of the table automatically.  If COL-DELIM-REGEXP and
ROW-DELIM-REGEXP are omitted the result table has only one cell and
the entire region contents is placed in that cell.  Optional JUSTIFY
is one of 'left, 'center or 'right, which specifies the cell
justification.  Optional MIN-CELL-WIDTH specifies the minimum cell
width.  Optional COLUMNS specify the number of columns when
ROW-DELIM-REGEXP is not specified.


Example 1:

1, 2, 3, 4
5, 6, 7, 8
, 9, 10

Running `table-capture' on above 3 line region with COL-DELIM-REGEXP
\",\" and ROW-DELIM-REGEXP \"\\n\" creates the following table.  In
this example the cells are centered and minimum cell width is
specified as 5.

+-----+-----+-----+-----+

Note:

In case the function is called interactively user must use \\[quoted-insert] `quoted-insert'
in order to enter \"\\n\" successfully.  COL-DELIM-REGEXP at the end
of each row is optional.


Example 2:

This example shows how a table can be used for text layout editing.
Let `table-capture' capture the following region starting from
-!- and ending at -*-, that contains three paragraphs and two item
name headers.  This time specify empty string for both
COL-DELIM-REGEXP and ROW-DELIM-REGEXP.

-!-`table-capture' is a powerful command however mastering its power
requires some practice.  Here is a list of items what it can do.

Parse Cell Items      By using column delimiter regular
		      expression and raw delimiter regular
		      expression, it parses the specified text
		      area and extracts cell items from
		      non-table text and then forms a table out
		      of them.

Capture Text Area     When no delimiters are specified it
		      creates a single cell table.  The text in
		      the specified region is placed in that
		      cell.-*-

Now the entire content is captured in a cell which is itself a table
like this.
