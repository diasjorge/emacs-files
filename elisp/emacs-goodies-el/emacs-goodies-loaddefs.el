Overview

    Folds are a way of hierarchically organizing the text in a file, so
    that the text can be viewed and edited at different levels. It is
    similar to Outline mode in that parts of the text can be hidden from
    view. A fold is a region of text, surrounded by special \"fold marks\",
    which act like brackets, grouping the text. Fold mark pairs can be
    nested, and they can have titles. When a fold is folded, the text is
    hidden from view, except for the first line, which acts like a title
    for the fold.

    Folding mode is a minor mode, designed to cooperate with many other
    major modes, so that many types of text can be folded while they are
    being edited (eg., plain text, program source code, Texinfo, etc.).

Folding-mode function

    If Folding mode is not called interactively (`(interactive-p)' is nil),
    and it is called with two or less arguments, all of which are nil, then
    the point will not be altered if `folding-folding-on-startup' is set
    and `folding-whole-buffer' is called. This is generally not a good
    thing, as it can leave the point inside a hidden region of a fold, but
    it is required if the local variables set \"mode: folding\" when the
    file is first read (see `hack-local-variables').

    Not that you should ever want to, but to call Folding mode from a
    program with the default behavior (toggling the mode), call it with
    something like `(folding-mode nil t)'.

Fold marks

    For most types of folded file, lines representing folds have \"{{{\"
    near the beginning. To enter a fold, move the point to the folded line
    and type `\\[folding-shift-in]'. You should no longer be able to see
    the rest of the file, just the contents of the fold, which you couldn't
    see before. You can use `\\[folding-shift-out]' to leave a fold, and
    you can enter and exit folds to move around the structure of the file.

    All of the text is present in a folded file all of the time. It is just
    hidden. Folded text shows up as a line (the top fold mark) with \"...\"
    at the end. If you are in a fold, the mode line displays \"inside n
    folds Narrow\", and because the buffer is narrowed you can't see outside
    of the current fold's text.

    By arranging sections of a large file in folds, and maybe subsections
    in sub-folds, you can move around a file quickly and easily, and only
    have to scroll through a couple of pages at a time. If you pick the
    titles for the folds carefully, they can be a useful form of
    documentation, and make moving though the file a lot easier. In
    general, searching through a folded file for a particular item is much
    easier than without folds.

Managing folds

    To make a new fold, set the mark at one end of the text you want in the
    new fold, and move the point to the other end. Then type
    `\\[folding-fold-region]'. The text you selected will be made into a
    fold, and the fold will be entered. If you just want a new, empty fold,
    set the mark where you want the fold, and then create a new fold there
    without moving the point. Don't worry if the point is in the middle of
    a line of text, `folding-fold-region' will not break text in the middle
    of a line. After making a fold, the fold is entered and the point is
    positioned ready to enter a title for the fold. Do not delete the fold
    marks, which are usually something like \"{{{\" and \"}}}\". There may
    also be a bit of fold mark which goes after the fold title.

    If the fold markers get messed up, or you just want to see the whole
    unfolded file, use `\\[folding-open-buffer]' to unfolded the whole
    file, so you can see all the text and all the marks. This is useful for
    checking/correcting unbalanced fold markers, and for searching for
    things. Use `\\[folding-whole-file]' to fold the buffer again.

    `folding-shift-out' will attempt to tidy the current fold just before
    exiting it. It will remove any extra blank lines at the top and bottom,
    (outside the fold marks). It will then ensure that fold marks exists,
    and if they are not, will add them (after asking). Finally, the number
    of blank lines between the fold marks and the contents of the fold is
    set to 1 (by default).

Folding package customizations

    If the fold marks are not set on entry to Folding mode, they are set to
    a default for current major mode, as defined by
    `folding-mode-marks-alist' or to \"{{{ \" and \"}}}\" if none are
    specified.

    To bind different commands to keys in Folding mode, set the bindings in
    the keymap `folding-mode-map'.

    The hooks `folding-mode-hook' and `<major-mode-name>-folding-hook' are
    called before folding the buffer and applying the key bindings in
    `folding-mode-map'. This is a good hook to set extra or different key
    bindings in `folding-mode-map'. Note that key bindings in
    `folding-mode-map' are only examined just after calling these hooks;
    new bindings in those maps only take effect when Folding mode is being
    started. The hook `folding-load-hook' is called when Folding mode is
    loaded into Emacs.

Mouse behavior

    If you want folding to detect point of actual mouse click, please see
    variable `folding-mouse-yank-at-p'.

    To customise the mouse actions, look at `folding-behave-table'.
