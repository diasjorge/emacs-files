;;; cyclebuffer.el --- select buffer by cycling through

;;; Commentary:

;; Description:
;; ------------
;; Cyclebuffer is yet another way of selecting buffers.  Instead of
;; prompting you for a buffer name, cyclebuffer-forward switches to the
;; most recently used buffer, and repeated invocations of
;; cyclebuffer-forward switch to less recently visited buffers.  If you
;; accidentally overshoot, calling cyclebuffer-backward goes back.  
;;
;; I find this to be the fastest buffer-switching mechanism; it`s like C-x
;; b <return> w/out the return, but it`s not limited to the most recently
;; accessed buffer.  Plus you never have to remember buffer names; you
;; just keep cycling until you recognize the buffer you`re searching for.

;; Installation:
;; -------------
;;   Add these lines in your .emacs:
;;     (autoload `cyclebuffer-forward "cyclebuffer" "cycle forward" t)
;;     (autoload `cyclebuffer-backward "cyclebuffer" "cycle backward" t)
;;     (global-set-key "M-N" `cyclebuffer-forward)
;;     (global-set-key "M-P" `cyclebuffer-backward)
;;
;;   You may want to adjust the keyboard bindings to avoid conflicts with
;;   whatever other packages you`re using...
